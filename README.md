# AtliQ Hardware - Business Insights 360

AtliQ Hardware recently experienced financial losses due to insufficient market research before launching a store in America. Observing that competitors leverage data-driven strategies to make informed decisions, AtliQ Hardware recognizes the need to establish its own data analytics team to adopt smarter decision-making processes and remain competitive in the industry.

## Project Overview

AltiQ Hardware, a fast-growing global company, specializes in selling computers and accessories through three primary channels: retailers, direct sales, and distributors. Despite its rapid growth, the company encountered unexpected losses after opening a new store in America. These challenges were initially identified through surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis.

With competitors leveraging advanced analytics teams, AltiQ Hardware recognized the pressing need to build robust analytics capabilities to remain competitive in the industry.

To gain an edge and embrace data-driven decision-making, AltiQ Hardware initiated the implementation of Power BI for analytics. The goal of this project was to equip stakeholders with actionable insights across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain functions, enabling informed decision-making at every level.

I contributed to this transformative project by applying skills gained from the Codebasics Power BI Course, ensuring a structured approach to developing impactful dashboards and reports.

## Datasets

Before diving into analysis, understanding the datasets is crucial. The datasets consist of two tables:

Dimension table: Static data like customer and product details.

Fact table: Transaction data.

gdb041:

- dim_customer
- dim_market
- dim_product
- fact_forecast_monthly - This table is used to forecast the customer’s need in advance, which can help in Higher customer satisfaction and reduced cost in warehouses for storage purposes
- fact_sales_monthly - This table is more or less is same as the fact_forecast_monthly table, but the last column has the value of the sold quantity instead of the forecast value.

gdb056:

- freight_cost
- gross_price
- manufacturing_cost
- Pre_invoice_dedutions
- Post_invoice_deductions

### The Importance of Data Modeling in Analytics

For this project, data was imported from MySQL into Power BI, where it was cleaned, transformed, and structured into a robust data model. But why is data modeling so critical for analysis?

If we break down the work of a data analyst, it typically involves four key steps:

✅ Data Extraction → ✅ Data Cleaning → ✅ Data Modeling → ✅ Data Analysis

The third step—Data Modeling—is indispensable if you want to reach the final step, Data Analysis. It serves as the backbone of any analytical report. A well-designed data model not only ensures accurate and efficient analysis but also enhances report performance and interactivity. Poor modeling, on the other hand, can lead to sluggish reports and unreliable insights.

In this project, we adopted the Snowflake schema for data modeling, ensuring a scalable and optimized foundation for building meaningful visualizations and reports.
